##NOOB Jax with Promises

NOOB Jax with Promises is a simple implementation of an AJAX library with promises. 

This is being made from educational purposes (my own and the NOOBjs.org readers). Use at your own risk!

Thanks to the folks over at [DailyJS](http://dailyjs.com/2011/06/09/framework-66/) for serving up great content, particularly the linked article on promises, which I used to get going on this library.
